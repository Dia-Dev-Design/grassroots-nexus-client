> This project is part of a full-stack web application that integrates a React front-end with an Express.js server, utilizing MongoDB as the database. The server-side, built with Express.js, provides a robust API for data handling, while the MongoDB database ensures efficient data storage and retrieval. The front-end is developed using React, offering an interactive UI that communicates with the backend via API calls. The project will serve as part of a platform that will help political campaigns handle and communicate information seamlessly and efficiently.
